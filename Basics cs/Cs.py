  # A source code definition in Python is a statement that defines a variable, function, class, or module. It typically includes the name of the entity being defined, its type (if applicable), and its initial value or implementation. 

  # A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Functions can take input parameters and can return a value. 

  # An expression in Python is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a new value. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or variable, or they can be more complex, involving multiple operations and function calls

# Pseudocode is a high-level description of an algorithm that uses the structural conventions of programming languages but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It omits specific syntax and focuses on the logic and flow of the algorithm.

# An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It is a precise and unambiguous sequence of instructions that can be implemented in a programming language to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.
